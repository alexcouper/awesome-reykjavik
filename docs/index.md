## The Trinity: Kennitala, Mobile Plan and Bank Account

If you have employment in Iceland, and assuming you have a permanent address,
this is the order of things:

1. :material-fingerprint: **Get a kennitala** →
   [Kennitala](guides/kennitala.md). This takes five days to process if all
   documents are submitted correctly. Start this process online before you
   depart.
2. :material-phone: **Get a mobile plan** → [Mobile
   plans](guides/mobile-phones.md). You'll need to
   visit a mobile branch and bring your passport. Use your non-Icelandic credit
   card for billing as you haven't opened a bank account yet.
3. :material-bank: **Get a bank account** → [Bank
   account](guides/bank-account.md). Visit a branch to open a bank account and set up your [electronic certificate](guides/audkenni.md).

There are of course other ways to go about it, but this is probably the
quickest way to onboard.
