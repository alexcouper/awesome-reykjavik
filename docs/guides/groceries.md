# Groceries

The grocery game is nothing to be proud of in Iceland. You will probably miss
this from home.

## Budget

Bónus and Krónan er the two big budget stores. Krónan has more specialty
products and more emphasis on presentation in stores that are big. Bónus has
more locations with more numerous smaller-scale ones.

There is also a Costco by the IKEA in Garðabær, but they run a franchise
arrangement where you will need to become a member to shop there (in bulk!).
Icelanders wen’t absolutely nuts when they opened a few years ago. IKEA also
have a budget mini-market after checkout.

Other budget picks: Nettó, Super1 (newcomer),

## Upscale

Hagkaup is upscale and pack a wider range of products. This is perhaps the only
place with a butcher’s counter and cheesemonger. Some Hagkaup stores have been
around for quite a long time. They stock arts and crafts, toys and kitchen
things too.

Melabúðin, perhaps even Fjarðarkaup in Hafnarfjörður, are worth a visit. These
stores are single location and seem to have more curation of produce and
service.

## Convenience

10-11 is a super expensive and touristy convenience store with a rather bad
uniform selection. The brand was founded on being open from 10 to 11, but they
quickly became 24/7 without changing their name, confusingly. Try to stay away
from these unless there is a crushing need for something.

Krambúð is a convenience store with a more local flavor.

## Online

[Heimkaup](http://heimkaup.is) and [Netto](http://netto.is) are the primary
home delivery grocery stores. Krónan will launch an app with an online store
soon.

Some stores have half-baked online solutions.
