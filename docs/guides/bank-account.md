# Opening a bank account

There are 3 banks in Iceland:

+ [Arion Banki](https://www.arion.is)
+ [Landsbanki](https://www.l.is)
+ [Íslandsbanki](https://www.islandsbanki.is)

The easiest way to open an account is to visit a branch in person. You'll need to have a [kennitala](./kennitala.md) and bring your passport. Make sure you register for online banking.

It's unlikely that you'll be able to get a credit card or any loans for your first year living in Iceland.

## Mobile payment apps

There are two popular mobile payment apps in Iceland: [aur](https://aur.is/) and [kass](https://www.kass.is/). These let you send money to a mobile number (useful for splitting the bill at a restaurant) and can be used to pay at certain places (for example Strætó and Dominios).

## Online banking

You can receive and pay most bills though your online bank. This include utility bills, tax, services from companies (accountants etc).
