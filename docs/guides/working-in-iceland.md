# Working in Iceland

It’s super easy for EU/EEA residents to relocate and work in Iceland. For
knowledge experts it’s quite possible, and for anyone else it’s a long and
difficult process.

## EU/EEA Trade agreements

Anyone with citizenship within the
[EU/EEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) area is allowed
to relocate freely and work in Iceland without any special license or work
permit. For anyone outside this area it becomes much more complicated.

## Worker’s rights

On paper and when enforced, worker’s rights in Iceland are strong. However,
many Icelandic companies do not respect worker’s rights. All workers earn 24
working days of summer holiday every year. They have additional sick leave
rights and cannot be asked to work an excessive amount of hours. They are
entitled to appropriate clothing and security at their workplace.

Look to [Efling](https://efling.is/?lang=en) immediately if you are a non-desk
worker and suspect your rights are not being observed.

## Expert knowledge workers

When companies require expert knowledge workers that are hard to find in Iceland and other EEA countries, they may contract an expert and acquire a temporary work permit on their behalf.

Many companies are unaware, or have not bothered to apply for special tax breaks for experts.
