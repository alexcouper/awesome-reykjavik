# Kennitala (Resident’s ID / National ID)

Nothing works without kennitala. Kennitala is the national ID system. It is a
10 digit with the first six in the DDMMYYY birthday format, the last digit being the century. Company’s also have kennitalas. 

## EU/EEA

It’s simple for residents of the EU/EEA to acquire a kennitala. 

!!! warning
    Only public authorities can apply for a kennitala. Individuals receiving
    salary in Iceland can work with their employer for Skatturinn (local tax
    authorities) to apply for kennitala at Skrá (the registers) for you.

First you obtain a 3-month temporary kennitala by [submitting this form](https://www.rsk.is/media/rsk03/rsk_0330.en.pdf) to Skatturinn (the tax authority). 

From here, if you intend to stay more than three months, you need to prove your EU/EEA residency after filing digitally an A-271 form. [More information on skra.is](https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/moving-to-iceland/i-am-an-eea-efta-citizen/).

If you intend to relocate without salary from an Icelandic employer you will need to go through the process of proving your subsistance wage.
