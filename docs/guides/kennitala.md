# Kennitala

*a.k.a. Resident’s ID / National ID*

Nothing works without kennitala. Kennitala is the national ID system. It is a
10 digit with the first six in the DDMMYYY birthday format, the last digit
being the century. Company’s also have kennitalas. There is no sensitive
information stored in the kennitala number, only your birthday.

!!! tip 
    If you are staying less than three months and are a national of the EU/EEA
    you can quickly obtain a 3-month temporary kennitala by [submitting an
    A-263 form](https://www.rsk.is/media/rsk03/rsk_0330.en.pdf) to Skatturinn
    (the tax authority). They will then get you a temporary kennitala in a few
    days.

## EU/EEA

It’s relatively simple for residents of the EU/EEA to acquire a kennitala. 

!!! warning
    Only public authorities can apply for a kennitala. Individuals receiving
    salary in Iceland can work with their employer for Skatturinn (local tax
    authorities) to apply for kennitala at Skrá (the registers) for you.

If you intend to stay more than three months you need to prove your EU/EEA residency after filing digitally an A-271 form. ).

!!! warning
    You will need the EXACT address of your temporary residence including the
    legally registered apartment number (usually in a four-digital format, 0301
    for "third floor apartment number one"). The address is queried dynamically
    and will not be found if you don’t include correct Icelandic alphabet
    letters such as ð, þ or ö. You may want to get this information emailed to
    you and copy-paste from there.

## Outside EU/EEU

The process here is similar (in theory), but you will likely need an employer
to vouch for you and get you on the expert knowledge program first. See the
[Working in Iceland guide](./working-in-iceland.md).
