# Cars

Icelanders love cars. We export energy and fish and import cars. We have
extremely high car ownership per household.

## Electric

We are number two in the world in the adoption of electric cars. The charging
infrastructure is subsidized and building up quickly.

[Veldu Rafbíl](https://veldurafbil.is) is an excellent place to start with
links to local resellers. It also indexes the electrics listed on Bílasölur.is.

## Used cars

The biggest used car aggregator is [Bílasölur.is](https://bilasolur.is). People
also buy and sell passenger vehicles on [Facebook (search results for "bílar
til sölu")](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=b%C3%ADlar%20til%20sölu&epa=SEARCH_BOX).
